Cryptography - the art of writing or solving codes.

Cryptography in the old days were very simple codes compared to now. Some
examples of these could be monoalphabetic substitution, transposition ciphers,
polyalphabetic ciphers, etc. These ciphers are called symmetric ciphers as you
use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the secret message.

Nowadays, the codes used to encrypt anything is far superior and with the invention of the computer it is much faster.

One of the most famous cryptographers in the information age is Alan Turing, who
not only deciphered the German enigma but also is considered the father of
computer science and AI. The fact that he cracked the Enigma, which was considered
the "uncrackable cipher", gave the impression that nothing could ever be encrypted
safely enough, until RSA came along, and after that, Elliptic-Curve. Even though
these ciphers in theory is crackable, the time to do so isn't feasible.

Good thing you never really have to think about much of this as the underlying
software on your PC is taking care of most of this encryption and decryption.

So let's start this of easy with some rail fence cipher. Don't use this cipher
for anything important, like a flag. Number of rails is 3. Now try to get the
flag.
