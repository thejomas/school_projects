Forensics - The art of scientific investigation and analysis

Taken directly from the inter webs:
    "Computer forensics is the application of investigation and analysis
    techniques to gather and preserve evidence from a particular computing
    device in a way that is suitable for presentation in a court of law."

Or in a boarder term, forensics is the art of investigating and analyzing
data. Data in this context can mean anything but for computer science
data is anything which can be found on a computer. Usually it revolves around
a case with some data which is either hidden, corrupted, or otherwise 
inaccessible. Making sense of this data is forensics.

Forensics is a very broad field in computer science with a lot of information 
and knowing every aspect of it is impracticable but knowing just a bit about 
everything helps a huge deal. The challenges in this CTF includes a bit from 
some different branches in the forensics field.

For this challenge, a flag is hidden in a JPG file.

Try opening the flag.jpg file with a picture viewer. 

Huh.. I didn't work? Maybe something is wrong with the file. Checking what kind
of file you are trying to open is always a good idea. On UNIX systems, a command
called file will tell you everything you might want to know about a file.

For Windows... pray notepad will show you something useful.
