Introduction:
=============
	Another introduction to stego challenges!
	All you have is a weird dictionary out of order, and all
	you have to do, is find the flag (which is unique)..!


Hints:
======
	- A flag looks like this: flag{This could be a flag!}
	  Notice it requires a starting bracket '{' AND an ending bracket '}'
	- The 'real' flag is unique.
