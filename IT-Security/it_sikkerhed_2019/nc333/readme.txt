*** NC333 (Misc/Crypto, 50) ***

** Intro **
Everyone tells me that i need to use some advanced encryption scheme for my flags...
But what do they know!? I'm CERTAIN that a ton of simple encryption techniques mashed
together is JUST as secure as that fancy 'public-key cryptography' thingy everyone
keeps talking about!

** Hint **
- The flag is of the format: CTF{some_text_here}
- Try and read the first few characters of the file for starters
